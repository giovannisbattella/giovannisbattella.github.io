<p>Italy’s labor market is posting its best performance in decades, with unemployment falling to levels once thought unattainable and dipping below the Euro-area average. Yet, beneath the headline figures lies a persistent paradox: a boom in jobs has not translated into meaningful prosperity for many workers, as real wages lag and structural weaknesses remain.

As of the second quarter of 2025, Italy's unemployment rate has stabilized at a multi-year low. Data from national statistics agency ISTAT showed the jobless rate at 6.5% in May, while Eurostat figures for April painted an even rosier picture at 5.9%, comfortably below the Eurozone average of 6.2%. The number of employed has surpassed 24 million, a record high driven by a surge in permanent contracts.

This newfound stability marks a significant shift. For years, Italy was plagued by double-digit unemployment, particularly among its youth. Now, the dynamic has inverted, with a notable increase in permanent positions (+2.4% year-on-year) and a sharp decline in temporary contracts (-5.5%), according to recent data. This suggests a move toward greater job security, a key objective for policymakers.

However, the quality of this growth is under scrutiny. The increase in employment has been concentrated in lower-productivity service sectors, such as tourism and logistics. This trend is a critical factor in Italy’s chronic wage problem.

While recent contract renewals have pushed nominal wages up by approximately 3.4% in early 2025, this has failed to compensate for years of lost purchasing power. One recent report highlighted a staggering 7.1% decline in real wages in 2025 compared to 2021. In a multi-decade comparison with its European peers, the gap is even more stark. Between 1991 and 2023, real wages in Germany and France grew by over €9,500, while in Italy they fell by nearly €1,100.

This divergence places Italy in a precarious position. While its medium-sized industrial firms often outperform German and French counterparts in productivity, this efficiency has not trickled down to the broader workforce. The result is a growing class of "working poor"—individuals who, despite having a job, struggle with the cost of living.

The outlook remains complex. The government can celebrate a clear victory on the employment front, having steered the labor market through post-pandemic turbulence more effectively than many predicted. But the challenge now shifts from creating jobs to creating better jobs. Without a significant boost to productivity across the economy and a durable recovery in real wages, Italy's labor market paradox—more people working, for less—is set to continue.</p>
