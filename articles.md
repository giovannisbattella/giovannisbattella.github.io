I am a macroeconomist specialized in the application of advanced statistical and econometric techniques to analyze complex global dynamics, assess policy impacts, and forecast future economic trends. My research is particularly focused on policy evaluation, natural disaster recovery and prevention, as well as risk assessment for nations. With a passion for data analysis and problem solving, I strive to provide insights that can drive informed decision-making.
