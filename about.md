I am a macroeconomist specializing in the application of advanced statistical and econometric techniques to unravel complex global dynamics, assess policy impacts, and forecast future economic trends. My research is particularly focused on policy evaluation, natural disaster recovery and prevention, as well as risk assessment for nations. With a passion for tackling critical global challenges, I strive to provide insights that drive informed decision-making and sustainable solutions.
